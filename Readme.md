## Scenarios

1. Get the list of users: https://dummyapi.io/data/v1/user?limit=10

2. Create a user: https://dummyapi.io/data/v1/user/create

2.1. Create a user with an already existing email address (negative test): https://dummyapi.io/data/v1/user/create

3. Get the users created under your account: https://dummyapi.io/data/v1/user?created=1

4. Create a post (blog post): https://dummyapi.io/data/v1/post/create

5. Get Post By id: https://dummyapi.io/data/v1/user/{{post_id}}/post?limit=10

6. Delete post by ID: https://dummyapi.io/data/v1/post/{{post_id}}

7. End-To-End Integration test: Create a test that creates a post, and asserts that the post has been created successfully. Deletes the post and makes sure that the post no longer exists
